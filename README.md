## **_`Instructions about how to create the application locally`_**

---

- First, create a folder on our computer

- Open the folder with VSC

- we need to install all necessary software, node, gitbush, postman, etc.

## **_`Run these commands given bellow :`_**

```
npm init -y

```

- Edit "`tsconfig.json`" file, change the rootDir and outDir directory

- Create a ".env" file for securing all necessary information

- After installing all necessary dependencies, we have to create all necessary file

  -Then we have to create our model with the necessary validation

  -We must have to handle the error from defferent layer like- validation error, cast error, duplicate error etc.

- We have to connect the server with our project, for this, we have to create database and connect with postgresql database, for this, we can follow the documentation from here: [https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql)

- Then create all the modules for routing, controlling, servicing

- Create and Connect the Git repository with the project

- Create ".gitignore" for avoiding to avoid sending all the sensitive files like ".env", also with dist and node_modes

  -We should check and fix our code by using eslint and Prettier before sending the code to GitHub

- We can run our server locally at `http://localhost:5000` or any other port.

- If we want to run a project from a Git repository, we have to clone or download the project from the GitHub repository. Then we have to implement everything locally.

- We should deploy our backend project for accessing from anywhere, like -vercel, cyclic_sh, heroku, etc.

## **_`Functionalities`_**
